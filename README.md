The backend of webfoto

## Description

This was a perfectly functionally backend for the project Webfoto. Unfortunately, the costumer used Plesk, that supported only php backends in an easy way. So, an equivalent backend was done in PHP and with time other functionalities were added to it, while this **Node.js** backend remained frozen. This backend would be actually quite better, in terms of maintainability, debugging, performance and other advantages given by the **Node.js** environment, so it is left here in case it could be maintained again and used in the future.
